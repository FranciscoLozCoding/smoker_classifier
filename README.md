# dsc478-project
This project will create jupyter notebooks and will attempt to create classification models for the kaggle smoker dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravduttakiit/smoker-status-prediction-using-biosignals?resource=download&select=train_dataset.csv).

Team: Matt Soria, Jack Leniart, Francisco Lozano
  
Tasks:  
1. Preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (ED)  
3. Baseline model creation  
4. Robust model creation (each team member will create their own models and as a team the best will be chosen)
5. Front-end application creation (optional)  

## Setting up environment
Pipfile and Pipfile.lock are present and can be used.  
If user's don't want to use Pipenv then a requirements.txt file is available as well.  

Additionally users will need to install the graphviz executable.  
This can be done with homebrew.  

```
brew install graphviz
```

## Directory setup
- data: folder that contains the raw data for the project  
- output: contains outputs such as data/graphs needed for the project - these outputs are generated by the jupyter notebooks  
- src: contains reusable code imported by the notebooks 
- app: contains the source code for the gradio app in HuggingFace
- images: contains the images used in the notebooks
- present: Contains our presentation material

## Final Report

The Final report is our `5_final_notebook`. For a more "reader friendly" view see the html file.

## App Deployment
We deployed our final model in HuggingFace via a gradio app. [Check it out!](https://huggingface.co/spaces/FranciscoLozDataScience/smoker_model)
